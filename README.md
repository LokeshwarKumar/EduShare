# EduShare
This project is a materials and documents sharing website for students where users and admins upload academic PDFs. User uploads are visible only after admin approval to ensure quality. I mainly worked on the backend using Spring Boot, building secure REST APIs, JWT authentication, and role-based access control, with React used for the frontend.
